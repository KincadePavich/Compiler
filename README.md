# Compiler
Our final version of our project is in Desktop/Compiler. From there, the IR is the final version, the complete compiler. The scanner, parser, and symbol table are each of their cumulative steps. So, if you want to look at our complete compiler, it is under the IR folder. Here is a link directly to the final version: https://github.com/tiasmith/Compiler/tree/master/Desktop/Compiler/IR
