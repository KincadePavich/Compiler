# Compiler
## By Kincade Pavich and Tiana Smith
This project was completed in 4 major steps.
1) Scanner
2) Parser
3) Symbol Table
4) IR Code, 3AC to 2AC, FINAL VERSION.

Each step was built and ran with its respective grading script to see
and verify functionality. Grading scripts are not currently within these
directories. The ANTLR jar file will also need to be downloaded and placed
within these directories.

**The exception to the above statements is `step4-final`. Everything is included
for our final compiler to be ran and tested against the grading script.**

This project was completed for CSCI-468, the Compilers course at Montana
State University. This was our senior capstone project.

This is a compiler for the TINY language built using Java and ANTLR.
Some aspects of the code are not as perfect as we would have liked them to be,
but this project was created for a school assignment with time constraints.
Feel free to reach out with questions about what we would have done differently.
Furthermore, our report covers some of this information, accessible within
the same folder you found this README. Thanks!
